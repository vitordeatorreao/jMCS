# jMCS - Java Multiple Classifiers Systems

Java Multiple Classifiers Systems is a Java library for building Multiple
Classifiers Systems (MCSs) on top of
[WEKA](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).

Since jMCS is heavily dependent on WEKA, it follows
[WEKA's Java requirement](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/requirements.html).
You can check jMCS's Java requirements, and which version of WEKA is needed, in
the table below.

| jMCS | WEKA | Java |
| --- | --- | --- |
| < 1.0 | 3.8.1 | 1.8 |
